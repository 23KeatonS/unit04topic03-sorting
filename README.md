Write the following static methods in `StringListSort.java`, and corresponding unit tests in `StringListSortTest.java`.

Each of these are static methods that take as input an `ArrayList` of strings. They don't return anything, but after execution, the `ArrayList` should be sorted into alphabetical order.

1. `selectionSort`

    Use the selection sort algorithm

2. `insertionSort`

    Use the insertion sort algorithm
